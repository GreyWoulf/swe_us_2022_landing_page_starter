# CSS/Flex Box Reinforcement Mini-task

This repo contains all the HTML and Javascript code that you need to begin your build of landing page for _EdgeLedger_, a fictional financial services company.

Fork the project, and then clone it to your local machine.

Your task will be to add content to the `css/styles.css` file, so that your product can look as much like the desired product as possible.

### Some things to note:

- You do not need to edit any of the `index.html` file, though feel free to do so
- There is some javascript attached to this project - while it is there to give the landing page some nice effect, you do not need to edit any of this
- All images, icons, and fonts have been provided, but feel free to change those as you want
- the repo also contains a .zip file of the solution - while you do not need to refer to this at all, it is there for you as a resource
